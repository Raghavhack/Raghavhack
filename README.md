## About Me
I am a B.Tech student in Mathematics & Computing (graduating 2028). I build interactive, responsive web applications using modern frontend stacks and aim to become a MERN / Full-stack developer. I enjoy turning UI designs into fast, maintainable code and applying algorithmic thinking to real-world problems.

---

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React, React Router, Redux (or Context API)
- Backend & Database: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Chrome DevTools, Postman
- Other: REST APIs, npm, webpack / Vite, basic familiarity with authentication and JWT

## Featured Projects

### Mental Health Helper AI — Flagship Project (Google Gen AI Hackathon)
**Status:** Prototype (built during Google Gen AI Hackathon)  
**Tech:** React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, OpenAI / Gen-AI integration (NLP pipelines), WebSockets (for live updates), OAuth for secure sign-in.  
**Overview:** This flagship project is an AI-driven mental health assistant designed to triage user mood, provide conversational support, and surface resources and actionable coping strategies. Built as a rapid, high-fidelity prototype during the Google Gen AI Hackathon, it showcases product thinking, scalable architecture decisions, and a polished UX.

**Key highlights**
- Real-time conversational interface with session context and safe-response filters.
- Custom prompts and prototype-level fine-tuning for empathy-focused replies.
- Tiered response system: immediate supportive messaging + structured follow-ups and resources.
- End-to-end demo with persistent (anonymized) user sessions and resource suggestions.
- Privacy-centric design choices: minimal logging, opt-in analytics, and clear user consent.

**Why it matters**
- Addresses mental health accessibility with pragmatic, user-first AI.
- Built and demoed under hackathon constraints — demonstrates rapid iteration, teamwork, and technical depth.

**Demo & Repo**
- Project repo (placeholder — replace with actual repo URL): `https://github.com/dashboard/mental-health-helper-ai`  
  *(Replace the above URL with the actual repository path for a direct link to the project.)*

**Quick start**
1. `git clone https://github.com/dashboard/mental-health-helper-ai.git`  
2. `cd mental-health-helper-ai`  
3. `npm install`  
4. Create `.env` with API keys and DB URI (see `.env.example`)  
5. `npm run dev` (frontend + backend concurrently)

---

### Other Projects
- **Amazon-clone (Frontend)** — Static & responsive clone built with HTML/CSS/JS; demonstrates pixel-perfect layout and responsive grid systems.
- **E-commerce UI (React)** — Product listing, basic cart flow, and form validation using React and local state.
- **Personal landing page** — Clean, accessible personal website showcasing projects and contact details.

(Full projects and detailed READMEs are available in the repositories on my GitHub profile.)

## What I’m Building Next
- Full MERN e-commerce flow with role-based auth & payment integration.
- Progressive Web App (PWA) version of the Mental Health Helper AI with offline-first features.
- A small library of reusable React components (UI kit).

## How to Work With Me
I’m open to collaborations, internships, and mentorship opportunities as I grow into a MERN / Full-stack role.  
Preferred communication channels:
- GitHub: `https://github.com/dashboard`
- LinkedIn: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghav-rastogi-b4553b312/`  

---

## How to Get the Most from My Repos
- Start with the repo `README.md` for setup and env instructions.
- For most projects: `npm install` → `npm run dev`.
- I follow a feature-branch workflow: feature branches → PR → review → merge to `main`.

---

## Keep an Eye On
- Major project: **Mental Health Helper AI** — a demo, walkthrough video, and case study will be posted in the project repo.
- Ongoing: several React & JS mini-projects focused on real-world UI patterns.
